# Accelerometer-Data-Cleaning
This project cleans data from a 2012 study where raw data was collected from cell phone accelerometers. The data was collected
from 30 subjects who performed six tasks: walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

There are 180 observations and 82 columns. The two key columns are "Test_Subject" and "activity". There's also a column that labels the activity values. The other values are summarized as an average of their original value.

# R - Based Data Cleaning

The R script in this repo will clean and format the data linked below. It assumes you've already unzipped the data, and requires
some slight modification to run on your machine. The working directory has to be set to where you unzipped the file linked below.

Example output from this code is also included in thise repo.
