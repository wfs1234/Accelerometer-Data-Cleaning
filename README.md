# Accelerometer-Data-Cleaning
This project cleans data from a 2012 study where raw data was collected from cell phone accelerometers. The data was collected
from 30 subjects who performed six tasks: walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

There are 180 observations and 82 columns. The two key columns are "Test_Subject" and "activity". There's also a column that labels the activity values. The other values are summarized as an average of their original value.
